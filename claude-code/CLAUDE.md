# Rules

## Workflows

- Follow these steps: `Investigation`, `Planning`, `Implementation`, `Verification`
- Ask for my confirmation before proceeding to the next step

### 1. Investigation

- Understand my instructions and goals, then summarize them in your own words
- Gather relevant files and information to investigate my request

### 2. Planning

- Create an implementation plan based on your investigation
- Propose the plan as a TODO list

### 3. Implementation

- Follow these software development principles:
  - YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It
  - KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
  - DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- Write all code comments and JSDoc descriptions in simple English

### 4. Verification

- After creating or modifying code, run the verification commands defined in the project's CLAUDE.md
